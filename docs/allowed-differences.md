# Allowed differences from the JS SDK

Behavior that intentionally differs from the JS SDK (`apify` on npm). Everything else should match.

## Configuration

- **"At home" has one source.** The JS SDK reads `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` both through `Configuration`
  (coerced like a boolean, so `0` and `false` are false) and directly with `!!process.env[...]` (so
  any non-empty value is true). Here it is always `Configuration::is_at_home`.
- **Invalid numbers are ignored.** A value such as `APIFY_PROXY_PORT=abc` falls back to the default
  with a warning. The JS SDK throws when the configuration is constructed.
